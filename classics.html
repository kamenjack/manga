  <h1>Classic Manga</h1>
 <p>
    These are some of my favorite manga, which have also received high ratings on many websites and forums. They’re great choices for anyone who’s just starting to explore manga.
  </p>
  

  
  <h2>Dragon Ball</h2>
  <p>
    The GOAT of shonen manga. Dragon Ball follows the adventures and growth of its protagonist, Son Goku, 
    from childhood to adulthood. Blending adventure, martial arts, friendship, and humor with legendary battle scenes that remain unmatched, 
    Dragon Ball is the perfect place to start if you want to explore shonen manga.

  <h2>GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka</h2>
  <p>
   GTO tells the story of a teacher who uses his own unique methods to educate students.
    As a manga from the 1990s, the social phenomena and student troubles it depicts are already over 30 years old. 
    Viewed through a modern lens, some aspects may feel outdated, but its exploration of what school and teachers truly mean to students remains timeless.

  <h2>Steel Ball Run</h2>
  <p>
    The seventh part of the JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure series—and the first after its reboot—Steel Ball Run is set in late 19th-century America 
    and follows a cross-country horse race where various competitors fight for their own beliefs and ambitions. Unlike previous installments that focused on clear battles between good and evil, 
    Steel Ball Run blurs the line between right and wrong, emphasizing that everyone fights for their own goals and convictions.

  <h2>Bakuman</h2>
  <p>
    Bakuman tells the story of two young men who dream of becoming manga artists. Told from the protagonists’ perspective,
    the series offers a detailed look into the inner workings of Japan’s manga industry—though with some artistic dramatization.
    If you’re interested in how manga are created in Japan, this is a great series to check out.
