   <h2>The History of Japanese Manga</h2>

  <p>
    The history of Japanese manga can be traced back to pre-World War II visual storytelling traditions. Works from the Edo period, such as <strong>ukiyo-e</strong> and <strong>kibyōshi</strong>, told stories through images, blending humor, satire, and social commentary, and laid the visual and narrative foundations for later manga.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern manga, in the sense we understand today, truly emerged after World War II. In the 1950s, manga artist <strong>Osamu Tezuka</strong> pioneered the modern manga style. His use of black-and-white printing for easier reproduction, cinematic paneling for smoother storytelling, and Disney-inspired cartoon characters made his works stand out. Among these innovations, the concepts of cinematic storytelling and black-and-white illustration became core principles of Japanese manga.

  <p>
    Manga in the 1950s was primarily considered children’s literature. As that generation of readers grew up, manga for <strong>teenagers, young adults, and adults</strong> began to emerge. By the 1980s, mainstream manga had largely been established as <strong>shonen-oriented</strong> (targeted at young male readers).
  </p>

  <p>
    Japanese manga was initially serialized in <strong>weekly magazines</strong>, with one chapter released per week, and simultaneously published in <strong>tankōbon</strong> volumes. <em>(Tankōbon refers to standalone collected editions of previously serialized chapters, making it convenient for readers to own a complete story.)</em> With the rise of the internet, digital manga gradually became a mainstream format.
