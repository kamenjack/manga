  <h1>History of Japanese Manga</h1>

  <h2>Early Origins</h2>
  <p>
    Manga originated from emakimono (scrolls) and illustrated works such as <em>Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga</em> dating back to the 12th century.
    During the Edo period (1603–1867), books of drawings like <em>Toba Ehon</em> further developed visual storytelling that would later be recognized as manga.
    The word "manga" became common in 1798 with works such as Santō Kyōden's picturebook <em>Shiji no yukikai</em>, and in the early 19th century, publications like Aikawa Minwa's <em>Manga hyakujo</em> and the <em>Hokusai Manga</em> books appeared.
    These early works often combined humor, satire, and romantic themes and were sometimes mass-produced using woodblock printing.
  </p>

  <h2>Pre-War Cultural Continuity and Western Influence</h2>
  <p>
    Scholars identify two major influences shaping modern manga. One emphasizes continuity with Japanese cultural and aesthetic traditions from the pre-war, Meiji, and pre-Meiji periods.
    The other focuses on post-war events, particularly during and after the Allied occupation of Japan (1945–1952), highlighting U.S. cultural influence such as comics, television, films, and Disney animations introduced by the GIs.
    Both forces contributed to stylistic innovation and the expansion of thematic content in manga.
  </p>

  <h2>Post-War Creativity and Key Artists</h2>
  <p>
    The post-war period witnessed an explosion of creativity. Artists like Osamu Tezuka, creator of <em>Astro Boy</em>, and Machiko Hasegawa, creator of <em>Sazae-san</em>, became hugely influential.
    Tezuka developed the "cinematographic" panel technique, using dynamic motion-like layouts with rapid zooms and slow-motion effects, which was widely adopted by later manga artists.
    Hasegawa focused on daily life and women's experiences, which became a hallmark of shōjo manga.
  </p>

  <h2>Emergence of Shōnen and Shōjo Manga</h2>
  <p>
    Between 1950 and 1969, a large readership emerged in Japan with the solidification of two main genres: <strong>shōnen manga</strong> for boys and <strong>shōjo manga</strong> for girls.
    In 1969, a group of female manga artists, later called the Year 24 Group, debuted their works. Artists like Moto Hagio, Riyoko Ikeda, Yumiko Ōshima, Keiko Takemiya, and Ryoko Yamagishi transformed shōjo manga, creating emotionally rich narratives and developing subgenres including romance, superheroines, and "Ladies Comics".
  </p>

  <h2>Modern Shōjo Manga</h2>
  <p>
    Modern shōjo manga often emphasizes love, self-realization, and teamwork.
    Popular examples include Pink Hanamori's <em>Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</em>, Reiko Yoshida's <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em>, and Naoko Takeuchi's <em>Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon</em>.
    Groups of girls working together are common in these narratives, highlighting friendship and cooperation alongside romance.
  </p>

  <h2>Manga for Male Readers</h2>
  <p>
    Male-oriented manga is divided by target age: <strong>shōnen</strong> for boys up to 18 and <strong>seinen</strong> for young men 18–30. These stories often feature action-adventure, slapstick humor, themes of honor, and sometimes explicit sexual content.
    The role of girls and women in these manga evolved to include solitary pretty girls (bishōjo), supporting female characters, and groups of heavily armed female warriors (sentō bishōjo).
    Popular themes include science fiction, technology, sports, and supernatural adventures.
  </p>

  <h2>Gekiga and Adult-Oriented Stories</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>gekiga</strong> style emerged in the late 1950s and 1960s, featuring adult-oriented, somber, and sometimes violent narratives that reflect the harsh realities of life.
    Artists like Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Sampei Shirato focused on political and social issues, as well as aesthetic dissatisfaction with conventional manga styles.
    Gekiga influenced later manga aimed at mature audiences, providing a serious and literary alternative to mainstream works.
  </p>

  <h2>Global Popularity</h2>
  <p>
    By the 21st century, manga achieved worldwide recognition. Relaxation of censorship in the 1990s led to the inclusion of more mature content.
    Manga continues to evolve stylistically and thematically, remaining a dominant form of entertainment and cultural expression globally.
    Its influence extends into anime, films, fashion, and pop culture, inspiring audiences across generations.
