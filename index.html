    <h1>Welcome to "The World of Japanese Manga"! </h1>
    <h2>Here you can explore the most popular manga...</h2>

    <p> Modern Japanese manga emerged after World War II and has flourished for several decades. They form one of the cornerstones of Japan’s anime industry, as many anime productions are adapted from original manga works. While manga literally means “comic book” in Japanese, it is used specifically to refer to Japanese comics because they differ greatly in style, storytelling, and cultural expression from their Western counterparts.</p>

  Japanese manga has grown into a wide variety of genres, each with its own distinct style.
